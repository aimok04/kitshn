**kitshn** is an unofficial multiplatform client for the
self-hosted [Tandoor recipe management software](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes). The app
is built with **Compose Multiplatform**, and **Material You** to deliver a modern, intuitive and
responsive
user experience and is developed for Android, iOS and Desktop.

Although kitshn is available to multiple platforms, the main focus is still on Android.
Some features are exclusive to that platform.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the app is currently in alpha phase. You can of course open issues for bugs,
> feedback, and feature ideas.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm just a hobbyist developing this app in my spare time. This app not only might, but is
> guaranteed to contain spaghetti code and actively ignores best practices.

> [!TIP]
> GrapheneOS users might need to disable the "Hardened memory allocator" or
> enable the "Exploit protection compatibility mode" for the app to run.
