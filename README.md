**kitshn** is an unofficial android client for the
self-hosted [Tandoor recipe management software](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes). The app
is built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Material You** to deliver a modern, intuitive and responsive
user experience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that the app is currently in alpha phase. You can of course open issues for bugs,
> feedback, and feature ideas.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm just a hobbyist developing this app in my spare time. This app not only might, but is
> guaranteed to contain spaghetti code and actively ignores best practices.
