Hey
Welp, kitshn v1.0.0 wasn't the final release compatible with Tandoor v1 after all.

This release just adds some general improvements and a beta info dialog when connecting to a Tandoor v2 instance:

    1. Italian has been added on Weblate (by @KindaArtsy).
    2. Improved timer detection with support for hours (#167).
    3. Implemented beta info dialog when connecting to a Tandoor v2 instance.
