Hey ✌️
Welp, **kitshn v1.0.0** wasn't the **final release** compatible with **Tandoor v1** after all.

This release just adds some **general improvements** and a **beta info dialog** when connecting to a
**Tandoor v2 instance**:

1. 🇮🇹 **Italian** has been added on **[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/kitshn)** (by
   @KindaArtsy).
2. Improved **timer detection** with support for **hours** (#167).
3. Implemented **beta info dialog** when connecting to a **Tandoor v2 instance**.
