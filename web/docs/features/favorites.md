# ❤️ Favorites

kitshn can remember your *Favorite* recipes.

The app will automatically create a recipe book which will store all recipes that you mark by pressing the **❤️ button** in the recipe *detail view*.

### Implementation
The recipe book that *kitshn* uses to store favorites is *tagged* with **» #KTSHNFAV «** in its description. 

This means that you can also utilize an *existing* recipe book as your favorites book by *deleting* the recipe book created by *kitshn* and appending **» #KTSHNFAV «** to the description of your recipe book.
