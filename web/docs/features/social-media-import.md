# 🔗 Social Media Import <Badge style="margin-top: 7px" type="tip" text="v2.0.0" /> <Badge style="margin-top: 7px" type="warning" text="AI powered" />

kitshn supports importing posts from **TikTok** and **Instagram**. This feature requires at least an *AI provider*.

You can share a post with *kitshn* or open the *kitshn* app, click the **Import** icon, then **» Import from Social Media «**, then paste the post URL.

kitshn will scrape the *post description* and *cover image* and will try to convert the post into a Tandoor recipe.

This feature is **not very stable** yet. Please feel free to report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/aimok04/kitshn).
